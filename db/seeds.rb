# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Sample Property
meeks = Property.create(name: "Meeks Property", address: "123 Meeks Way Sacramento, CA 95834", image: "https://foyr.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/design-your-dream-home.jpg" user_id: user);
